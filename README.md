# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh




This project was built with **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, focusing on smooth route navigation. It includes a **CTA button** for redirecting to the welcome page and a **footer** with social media links and contact details for enhanced user engagement.


The project is responsive to 390px (mobile screen) and 1536px (desktop screen)

You may use devtool to test the responsiveness.
